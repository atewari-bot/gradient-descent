# gradient-descent

This application visualizes the gradient descent algorithm on a simple quadratic function.

You can adjust the learning rate, number of iterations, and initial point using the sidebar.

The red points represent the steps taken by the gradient descent algorithm.

The dashed lines show the path taken from one point to the next.

Function: $f(x) = x^2$
 
Gradient: $f'(x) = 2x$
